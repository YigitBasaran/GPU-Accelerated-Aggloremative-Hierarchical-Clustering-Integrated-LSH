Project Deliverables:

 1. gpu.py: Includes implementation of the project on GPU.

 2. cpu.py: Includes implementation of the project on CPU.

 3. main.py: Includes the input arguments, generating random
data and random hash vectors, calculation of original, gpu 
and cpu silhoutte score functions. Also imports gpu.py and cpu.py 
files to obtain the results according to the given input arguments.

4. experiment.py: Includes the experimental run_clustering function, 
which executes CPU and GPU codes and calculates the cpu & gpu times, 
silhoutte scores etc. Input arguments are given as a list immediately 
after run_clustering function definition. Furthermore, it draws related 
plots and gives the table data as csv file which are held in project report.
